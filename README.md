# IB9JHO Lab 2 - Flow control
To complete this lab, fill in all the function definitions in src/exercises.c.
You can try out the output of individual functions by calling them in src/main.c 
and running the program.

# Test and submit
If all the function definitions are correct then all the tests should pass when you run CTest.
Once you have confirmed this, submit your work by pushing your changes to the repository.
You can use the commit message "Submit assignment" or something similar.
